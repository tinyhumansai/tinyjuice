//! Per-content-kind compressors and the registry that maps a [`ContentKind`]
//! to the [`Compressor`] that handles it.
//!
//! Each compressor preserves the signal its kind carries — errors in logs,
//! changed hunks in diffs, signatures in code, anomalous rows in JSON — and
//! drops the rest. Lossy compressors leave recovery to the router
//! ([`crate::compress`]), which offloads the original to
//! the CCR cache and appends a retrieval marker. Compressors therefore return
//! only the compacted body and a `lossy` flag; they never touch the cache.
